Hello!! I’m Kari and I’m currently a senior design student at Simon Fraser University in the School of Interactive Arts & Technology, studying graphic and interface design.I have a passion for creating simple, creative, and modern branding and interface designs. In addition I love typography. I consistently point out and critique branding, posters and advertisements as I walk down the street. In my spare time I enjoy creating print designs to sell in my etsy shop, Wicked Pixie Design.

Outside of designing I love enjoying the outdoors, drinking Starbucks frappuccinos and most importantly irish dancing! Irish dance has been my first passion since I was five years old. It has allowed me to travel, meet new people, and experience new things.
