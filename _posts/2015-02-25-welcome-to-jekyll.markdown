I am a senior design student at Simon Fraser University in the School of Interactive Arts and Technology, studying graphic and interface design.

I believe that design has the power to visually influence its audience. Additionally, leave an impactful lasting impression. Design is a part of people’s everyday lives from the logo on their coffee cup to the large advertisements at SkyTrain stations. In my works I aim to create simple minimalistic designs through the use of colour, shapes, and structure. I want my designs to speak for itself especially within the creation of branding. A company’s brand should showcase its personality, professionalism and credibility without having to say it
