I am a senior design student at Simon Fraser University in the School of Interactive Arts and Technology, studying graphic and interface design.

I believe that design has the power to visually influence its audience. Additionally, leave an impactful lasting impression. Design is a part of people’s everyday lives from the logo on their coffee cup to the large advertisements at SkyTrain stations. In my works I aim to create simple minimalistic designs through the use of colour, shapes, and structure. I want my designs to speak for itself especially within the creation of branding. A company’s brand should showcase its personality, professionalism and credibility without having to say it


You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
